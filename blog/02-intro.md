# the Introduction chapter: Migratory Behavior and other hard-to-model traits 
 
 ""A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably." Wittgenstein 

This dissertation explores the intersection of complex traits, methodological approaches in macroevolution, and an exploration of these topics in the evolution of bird migration.

It is structured around three key questions:

1. How effectively do our current methods identify and analyze 'complex' biological traits when simplified into discrete states?

2. To what extent can migration in birds, as a complex trait known to have many axes of continuous variation, be adequately represented by discrete states?

3. What insights can we gain by pushing the limits of discrete state analysis in the context of complex traits?

These three questions form the backbone of each chapter, in order. 

## The challenge of representing complex traits in comparative biology

### what is a complex trait 

When we attempt to define "complex traits" in biology, we encounter a fundamental issue: the term "complex" is used to describe phenomena at virtually every scale of biological organization. In many ways this is just normal biology -- 

heterogenity 

systems thinking / networks 

This ambiguity reflects a broader pattern in biological thinking – a pendulum that swings between reductive and holistic approaches (Levins & Lewontin, 1980 , Wagner 'Character concept' ).  Reductive thikinbg seeks to understand biological phenomena by breaking them down into their constituent parts, based on the success of this approach physics and chemistry (Wagner). It suggests that the answer to most of our questions, regardless of scale, can be found via a thorough investigation of underlying principles, causes, and types. This mentality stems from the idea that everything in biology can be reduced to causally-related parts – DNA codes for amino acids, which form proteins, which give us phenotypes.

Holistic Thinking on the other hand emphasizes the importance of considering biological systems as integrated wholes. It recognizes that the interactions between components can lead to emergent properties that are not predictable from studying the parts in isolation.

(this dichotomy is an example of reductive thinking) 

(violently going back in forth doesn't lead to useful progress as much anymore, your guess is as good as mine as to why. We need a dialetic as per Levins & Lewontin)

- ok so what. when everybody *knows* categrorizations often leave information on the table, so much so that this is an ongoing joke in talks, etc (Dr. Spicer example -- one economist comes up with a binary discretization, another person comes and adds a third variable, another comes and adds a fourth ... and so on). Everyone basically knows that this is not "real") 


### ok, what is a complex trait 

In the context of this pendulum, complex traits represent a challenge that pushes us to integrate both reductive and holistic perspectives. Its clear to most biologists that to fully understand a trait you need to take a flexible approach to these types of thinking, alternating between reducing important aspects to measureables and drafting hypotheses based on what you know about the entire system.

When I am talking about a complex trait, what I mean is a trait that is defined in one (or all) of these ways: 

1. Influenced by multiple genes or gene networks and environmental factors
2. Typically exhibiting a continuous distribution in populations rather than discrete categories
3. Emerging from the interplay of various biological processes

Complex traits emerge from the interplay of various biological processes:

* Molecular biology: Various cellular and physiological mechanisms integrate to produce the final phenotype.
* Population genetics / genomics: Allele frequencies and their changes over time contribute to trait variation. Genome-Wide Association Studies find multiple genetic loci for a single trait's expression. (Sella & Barton 2019)
* Developmental Biology: The processes of growth and differentiation during an organism's life cycle shape the expression of complex traits.
* Ecology: Environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions to influence trait expression.

## comparative macroevolution 

Complex traits present a significant challenge in macro-evolutionary biology. As a field, macroeovlution is concerned with the patterns of speciaiton and extinction as well as how traits change over species-level time (deep time, phylogenetic time -- Schluter 2024, Mayr 1982). At it's core is the holistic idea that to understand what is happening on the species level, a researcher first needs to understand what occurs within and between indivudals, as well as populations (phylogenetic naturalism, Uyeda 2018). 

To do this researchers  need to summarize these traits at the species level, reducing the rich, continuous variation to discrete categories or summary statistics while maintaing the axes of evolutionary change (). 

The field of macroevolution has undergone significant transformations in its approach to trait analysis. In the early days of phylogenetics and cladistics, researchers devoted considerable effort to "character construction"—the meticulous selection of important trait aspects for comparative studies and tree creation.

(the 30 year method boom Felsenstein till Now) 

Recently the field has witnessed two parallel trends: the proliferation of statistical phylogenetics and diverse methodological breakthroughs and a cultural shift towards "big data" approaches in biology. These developments have led to a renewed focus on the careful consideration of traits, albeit from a more quantitative perspective.


## Migration as a Complex Trait

Applying macroevolution methods to bird migration serves as an interesting case study of how to best treat a complex trait that you know is under-served by discrete categorization. Migratory behavior involves a suite of interconnected behavioral, physiological, and morphological adaptations that enable birds to move in response to seasonal or other changes. 

The complexity of avian migration is evident in its confusing genetic basis (), environmental sensitivity () and general plasticity ().  Combined with the fact that many other species, from completely different taxonomic groups (Insects -- dragonflies; Mammals -- ungulates; Amphibians -- salamanders) also display migratory behavior with the same depth (and arguably similar scope, such as the long-distance migratory dragonfly *Pantala flavescens*, Hedlund 2021), migratory behavior becomes diffcult trait to neatlycategorize. 

In many ways, migration can be considered a "non-trait" in the sense that it is just a pattern of movement, due to predictable seasonal variability. When the seasonal variability gets less consistent, the pattern of movement also changes -- nomadism, or irruptive migration (Teitelbaum & Mueller 2019). Is this still part of the migration trait? Somewhere on the axis of resident to full migrant? I explore this logic in Chapters 2 and 3. 

It is much more useful to look at the component traits of migration than to think of it as a behaviroal suite, so let's do some reducing. 

### Component Traits and Plasticity

Generally migration is understood as the confluence of many component traits, often considered to have unique orgins seperate from the evolution of migration (Zink 2003). This includes things like navigation, orientation, migratory restless (Zunghure, ), pre-migration physiological behaviors, and so on. 

These components, like the migration behavior itself, also exhibit plasticity, meaning that some individuals within a population might exhibit differential behavior. 

The long-term research program of Berthold & Pulido () on the genetics of "Zunghure" (restlessness) in Eurasian blackcaps (*Sylvia atricapilla*)  suggests that within a bird considered a "partial migrant", where not every population migrates but some do, it's possible to breed the most restless birds together to make a resident population into a migratory populations (), as well as vis-versa (Pulido & Berthold 2010). 

For instance long-distance obligate migration almost always requires navigation in some form (and this is known to be as varied as one can imagine, there's importantly a difference between navigation and "orientation" in development and function Able & Bingman 1987), a period of physiological changes, migratory restlessness, detection of environmental deterioration. 

Hyperphagia and physiological changes 



### Diversity of migratory behavioars


When we consider all these components holistically, it becomes evident that migration is not a simple binary trait that can be switched on or off. Instead, "being a migratory bird" (or "being a sedentary bird")  encompasses a wide spectrum of behaviors and adaptations, potentially as diverse as the number of migrating individuals. As Zink (2005) suggests, what we perceive as migration is actually a constellation of many different traits, each with its own evolutionary history.

The ease with which a species can adopt or abandon migratory behavior depends on its particular collection of adaptations and components. To illustrate this point, consider two extremes: first, a flightless or blind bird in a rainforest habitat: Such a species would face considerable evolutionary inertia against developing migratory behavior. Even if faced with drastic environmental changes necessitating migration, it could be effectively stranded in macroevolutionary space, with limited options for adaptation. Compare this fictional species to a  highly dispersive, currently migratory bird: This other species might have the flexibility to quickly transition to a resident state if conditions change ...

While acknowledging this complexity, it's useful for our discussion to categorize migratory behaviors, even if these categories are necessarily incomplete. Adapting from Eyers et al. (2017), we can broadly classify birds as: Sedentary or resident, Obligate migrants, Irruptive (or dispersive) migrants and Nomadic migrants. It's important to note that these categories may not be uniformly applicable across species or taxonomic groups. As Zink (2005) points out, it would be misguided to expect these traits to evolve together as a "syndrome" without recognizing that they didn't necessarily arise as a package deal for any given clade or species.

Within this framework, we can consider "partial migration" as an additional descriptor, indicating the degree of variation within a given migratory category


- (Lundberg 2021 "Inversion" -- one species, willow warbler)

I am not suggesting that I am the first person to consider these facts about migration, this is well understood by the global ornithologist hive-mind (Berthold ,Eyers et al. 2017;; Zink )

### Challenges in macroevolutionary analysis : how do people *think* that migration may have evolved aross birds

The complexity of migration poses significant challenges for macroevolutionary analysis. Traditional approaches often rely on discrete trait categorizations, but as we've seen, migratory behavior resists such simplification. Are two resident species truly comparable in their 'residentness'? Similarly, can we assume all migratory species are equally migratory? These questions highlight the need for more nuanced approaches in comparative studies. 


Furthermore, the high degree of intraspecific variation and plasticity in migratory behavior complicates species-level analyses. It's not enough to study individual species or even populations; we need methods that can account for the full spectrum of variation within and between species


-  This means, in addition to comparative biologists being kind of clueless about the "true past" of the trait -- it isn't enough to just ruthlessly study individual species, or even individuals within a population to be able to get an answer 

- Capturing continuous variation in comparative studies
- Accounting for intraspecific variation and plasticity

This means searching for the "origin" of migration just in birds is not only considered a fool's errand, but a misunderstanding of what is so interesting about the trait (Zink 2003, taking some liberty here).  

> "Of course, it is currently unknown whether migration or its components actually contain little phylogenetic information, as was once assumed incorrectly for behavioral traits. For this and other reasons, phylogenetic analyses of migration should attempt to use a framework in which components of migration are separately mappe....For example, two migratory sister species might differ only in the period of Zugunruhe, migratory direction or compass systems, and classifying each as “migratory” is misleading when trying to understand evolutionary modifications." (Zink 2005)

**it doesn't matter what the origin of migration is, actually **

im convinced this is not what even the most die-hard ornithological scientists are interested in. Mostly cause if you look close, there's no answer to this question (Bell 2000).

The origin of soemthing like the "control" of migration might be of more interest. How can bird species just stop migrating? Migration can change within an individual's lifetime (Aikens et al 2023). 

- can you always go back to being a resident species? 
- whats the difference between a 

- southern home 

### bringing it all together 

- site-fidelity as a component that could explain how migration started and persisted over time. IF we take this seriously it gives us a much different understanding of which parts of trait space could be acessiable to each other

# conclusion

Through this research, I seek to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about how best to represent and analyze complex biological traits in the era of big data and advanced statistical methods, using bird migration.


# note to 

- overarching focus on Nearctic birds (why we do this?) 
- why do people care about migration in birds anyway?
