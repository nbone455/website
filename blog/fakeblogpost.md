# Complex traits in macroevolutionary biology
**Nic Bone**

last edit: 9.14.24



This dissertation explores the intersection of complex traits, methodological approaches in macroevolution, and an exploration of these topics in the evolution of bird migration.

My dissertation is structured around three key questions:

1. How effectively do our current methods identify and analyze 'complex' biological traits when simplified into discrete states?

2. To what extent can migration in birds, as a complex trait known to have many axes of continuous variation, be adequately represented by discrete states?

3. What insights can we gain by pushing the limits of discrete state analysis in the context of complex traits?

## The challenge of representing complex traits in comparative biology


### what is a complex trait 

When we attempt to define "complex traits" in biology, we encounter a fundamental issue: the term "complex" is used to describe phenomena at virtually every scale of biological organization. In many ways this is just normal biology -- 

heterogenity 
systems thinking / networks 

 This ambiguity reflects a broader pattern in biological thinking – a pendulum that swings between reductive and holistic approaches (Levins & Lewontin, 1980). 

Reductive Thinking: This approach seeks to understand biological phenomena by breaking them down into their constituent parts. It suggests that the answer to most of our questions, regardless of scale, can be found via a thorough investigation of underlying principles, causes, and types. This mentality stems from the idea that everything in biology can be reduced to causally-related parts – DNA codes for amino acids, which form proteins, which give us phenotypes.

2. Holistic Thinking: This perspective emphasizes the importance of considering biological systems as integrated wholes. It recognizes that the interactions between components can lead to emergent properties that are not predictable from studying the parts in isolation.

(this is an example of reductive thinking) 

(violently going back in forth doesn't lead to useful progress as much anymore, your guess is as good as mine as to why. We need a dialetic as per Levins & Lewontin)

### ok, what is a complex trait 
In the context of this pendulum, complex traits represent a challenge that pushes us to integrate both reductive and holistic perspectives. Its clear to most biologists that to fully understand a trait you need to take a flexible approach to these types of thinking, alternating between reducing important aspects to 


When I am 

1. Influenced by multiple genes or gene networks and environmental factors
2. Typically exhibiting a continuous distribution in populations rather than discrete categories
3. Emerging from the interplay of various biological processes

Complex traits emerge from the interplay of various biological processes:

* Molecular biology: Various cellular and physiological mechanisms integrate to produce the final phenotype.
* Population genetics / genomics: Allele frequencies and their changes over time contribute to trait variation. Genome-Wide Association Studies find multiple genetic loci for a single trait's expression. (Sella & Barton 2019)
* Developmental Biology: The processes of growth and differentiation during an organism's life cycle shape the expression of complex traits.
* Ecology: Environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions to influence trait expression.

## comparative macroevolution 

Complex traits present a significant challenge in macro-evolutionary biology. As a field, macroeovlution is concerned with the patterns of speciaiton and extinction as well as how traits change over species-level time (deep time, phylogenetic time -- Schluter 2024, Mayr 1982). At it's core is the holistic idea that to understand what is happening on the species level, a researcher first needs to understand what occurs within and between indivudals, as well as populations (phylogenetic naturalism, Uyeda 2018). 

To do this researchers  need to summarize these traits at the species level, reducing the rich, continuous variation to discrete categories or summary statistics while maintaing the axes of evolutionary change (). 

The field of macroevolution has undergone significant transformations in its approach to trait analysis. In the early days of phylogenetics and cladistics, researchers devoted considerable effort to "character construction"—the meticulous selection of important trait aspects for comparative studies and tree creation.

(the 30 year method boom Felsenstein till Now) 

Recently the field has witnessed two parallel trends: the proliferation of statistical phylogenetics and diverse methodological breakthroughs and a cultural shift towards "big data" approaches in biology. These developments have led to a renewed focus on the careful consideration of traits, albeit from a more quantitative perspective.
