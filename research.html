  <h1>General Research Interests</h1>
  
  <h2>History and Future of Evolutionary Biology</h2>
  <p> The convergence of past contributors in the field, their cultural context, and the resulting assumptions, biases, and inferences that shape evolutionary thinking has always captivated me. 
  I believe that fully acknowledging and reconciling this historical legacy with the present is crucial for advancing evolutionary research beyond the constraints of systemic racism, eugenics, and unjustified discrimination.
  I hope to eventually expand my interest in this convergence into a more formal research effort.  </p>
  
  
  <h2>Axes of Avian Migration</h2>
  <p> The study of avian migration poses unique challenges due to the wide range of trait axes involved, many of which are difficult to measure directly. These axes, such as the year-over-year varaition in movement , can provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history of birds. 
    Finding effective ways to measure and model these hard-to-measure axes is crucial for understanding how migration at-large evolves over time, as well as what the relationships between migration and other traits may be like.
