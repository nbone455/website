  <h1>General Research Interests</h1>
  
  <h2>History and Future of Evolutionary Biology</h2>
  <p> The convergence of past contributors in the field, their cultural context, and the resulting assumptions, biases, and inferences that shape evolutionary thinking has always captivated me. 
  I believe that fully acknowledging and reconciling this historical legacy with the present is crucial for advancing evolutionary research beyond the ignominy of the field's active justification of systemic racism, eugenics, and discrimination.
  I hope to eventually expand my interest in this convergence into a more formal research effort.  </p>
  
  
  <h2>Axes of Avian Migration</h2>
  <p> The study of avian migration presents distinctive challenges due to the diverse array of trait axes involved, many of which are challenging to measure directly. These axes encompass various aspects of th behavior, such as the year-over-year variation in movement, which can offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of birds. 
    Developing effective methods to measure and model these difficult-to-measure axes is essential for comprehending the long-term evolution of migration as a whole, as well as understanding the interconnectedness between migration and other traits.
