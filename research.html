  <h1>General Research Interests</h1>
  
  <h2>Axes of Avian Migration</h2>
  
  <h3>Hard-to-Measureness</h3>
  
  <h2>Phylogenetic Comparative Methods</h2>
  <h3>Trait Evolution</h3>
  <p>Employing phylogenetic comparative methods to study the evolution of traits across species, investigating trait diversification, ancestral state reconstruction, and the influence of ecological factors.</p>
  
  <h2>History and Future of Evolutionary Biology</h2>
  <p> The convergence of past contributors in the field, their cultural context, and the resulting assumptions, biases, and inferences that shape evolutionary thinking has always captivated me. 
  I believe that fully acknowledging and reconciling this historical legacy with the present is crucial for advancing evolutionary research beyond the constraints of systemic racism, eugenics, and unjustified discrimination.
  I hope to eventually expand my interest in this convergence into a more formal research effort.  </p>
