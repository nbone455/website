  <h1>General Research Interests</h1>
  
  <h2>Phylogenetic Comparative Methods</h2>
  <p> Much of my work involves leveraging existing pieces of phylogenetic comparative methods to answer interesting biological questions. I'm usually more interested in how we arrive at the answer rather than a specific type of question or a group of organisms. 
    So, if you'd like to collaborate on a question you can't figure out how to model, feel free to reach out! </p>
   
  <h2>Axes of Avian Migration and 'difficult to measure' traits</h2>
  <p> The study of avian migration presents distinctive challenges due to the diverse array of trait axes involved, many of which are difficult to measure directly. This is a common problem in comparative biology, as many times the traits that researchers are interested in are difficult to wrangle into a simple dataset.
      Developing effective methods to measure and model these difficult-to-measure axes is essential for comprehending the long-term evolution of migration as a trait, as well as understanding the interconnectedness between migration and other traits.

    <h2>History and Future of Evolutionary Biology</h2>
  <p> The convergence of past contributors in the field, their cultural context, and the resulting assumptions, biases, and inferences that shape evolutionary thinking has always captivated me. 
  I believe that fully acknowledging and reconciling this historical legacy with the present is crucial for advancing evolutionary research beyond the ignominy of the field's active justification of systemic racism, eugenics, and discrimination.
  I hope to eventually expand my interest in this convergence into a more formal research effort.  </p>
