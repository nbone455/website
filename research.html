    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
  
   <h2>Translating domain knowledge to testable models</h2>
  <p> I am fascinated by the challenge of translating domain expertise into actionable, testable frameworks. This involves converting expert knowledge, often in non-testable forms like narratives or general insights, into specific, meaningful statistical models or machine learning approaches. For instance, in my work on birds, experts might view migration as a threshold trait or consider variability in migratory behavior significant in the trait's evolutionary history. 
    My interest lies in modeling these ideas quantitatively â€“ how can we define migratory thresholds or measure behavioral variability in a way that yields practical insights? Additionally, I'm keen on exploring underutilized classical concepts in previously published work, transforming them into testable hypotheses using both conventional statistical models and advanced machine learning techniques. 
    This approach not only bridges the gap between rich, untapped expert knowledge and empirical research but also paves the way for innovative solutions in areas that need both domain knowledge and statistical follow-through. </p>

  
  <h2>History and Future of Evolutionary Biology</h2>
  <p> The convergence of past contributors in the field, their cultural context, and the resulting assumptions, biases, and inferences that shape evolutionary thinking has always captivated me. 
  I believe that fully acknowledging and reconciling this historical legacy with the present is crucial for advancing evolutionary research beyond the ignominy of the field's active justification of systemic racism, eugenics, and discrimination.
  I hope to eventually expand my interest in this convergence into a more formal research effort. </p>

  <h2>Quantifying Migratory Behavior with eBird</h2>
  <p> <p> The study of avian migration presents a distinctive challenge due to the many ways a bird can be consider a 'migrant', most of which are difficult to measure directly. This is a common problem in comparative biology, as many times the traits that researchers are interested in are difficult to wrangle into a simple dataset.
      Developing effective methods to measure and model these difficult-to-measure axes is essential for comprehending the long-term evolution of migration as a trait, as well as understanding the interconnectedness between migration and other traits. By analyzing a vast dataset from eBird, 
      this project aims to shed light on the myriad ways in which birds migrate. Whether following predictable patterns or moving in more unpredictable ways, understanding these behaviors has profound implications for conservation and ecological studies</p>
